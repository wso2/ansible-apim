# - name: Apply API Management <profile> configuration to an apim node
#   hosts:
#     - apim_1

#
# If you like to start two roles of APIM at a single node, you can achieve that by adding both roles under roles:. An
# example is give below. This will start both API Manager default profile and API Manager developer portal profile in the
# same apim_1 node.

# - name: Apply API Management developer portal configuration to an apim node
#   hosts:
#     - apim_1
